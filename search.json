After going through three Startup Pre-accelerator programs, Pookie has now changed the direction of two of its ideas. Pookie wants to completely transform the way early-stage jobseekers and students interact with small and medium-sized businesses. We tackle this by beginning as an All-in-One Career Analytics platform that links small and medium-sized businesses with job searchers.\nPookie is your best friend, created by students for students and by a small-to medium-sized business for small-to medium-sized businesses. Pookie is there for you during good times and bad. It provides you with the best job recommendations and chances because it knows you better than you do. Even opportunities you never knew you needed."
