# Welcome {#sec-welcome}

This onboarding site is here to guide you through the workflow that you'll be
following starting Monday, from Week 4, Semester 1, all the way to the end of
the year. It's a long journey ahead, but we're excited to have you on board!

![Pookie Logo](pookie-logo-default.svg)

Let's dive in and get started.

# GitHub {#sec-github}

Version control system is nowadays the central part to all software development
nowadays. For this project, we will be using GitHub for the main version control
mechanism. Therefore, can we please have you register, if not done yet, a GitHub
account. Then, please send the emails you have registered to us **_as soon as
possible so that we can add you on the project_**. This is important as you need
to be in the organisation before you can finish tasks in @sec-first-contrib.

:::{.callout-tip title="GitHub Pro Account" collapse="true"}

As an ANU student you are legible for getting a GitHub Pro account, make sure
you get that benefits and don't fall in the trap of opening another account
(which I did). You can use your existing account to get the benefits.

# Project Overview {#sec-project-overview}

## Project Background

The concept was first conceived in September 2024 as a platform that would
enhance the fields of education and hiring. After going through three Startup
Pre-accelerator programs, Pookie has now changed the direction of two of its
ideas. Pookie wants to completely transform the way early-stage jobseekers and
students interact with small and medium-sized businesses. We tackle this by
beginning as an All-in-One Career Analytics platform that links small and
medium-sized businesses with job searchers.

Pookie is your best friend, created by students for students and by a small-to
medium-sized business for small-to medium-sized businesses. Pookie is there for
you during good times and bad. It provides you with the best job recommendations
and chances because it knows you better than you do. Even opportunities you
never knew you needed.

## Team Structure

I have included a brief overview of the different team members and the roles

: Roles Table {#tbl-member-role .hover .striped}

_Btw: Please just call us with our first names..._

### Getting to Know Each Other

Thanks for reading up until this stage. We have introduced ourselves and the
corresponding roles already, a task for you is to sort out the roles
distribution of your team with your tutor (if you have not done so)! Ideally, we
would like to have about equal numbers of frontend and backend developers.

:::{.callout-tip title="Some Questions to Answer" collapse="false"}

- Is there a fixed role for everyone?
- Or would the roles be changing throughout the year?
- Any strong preference for a particular role?
- What are you good at / know of in terms of web dev?

:::

After you have sorted out yourselves, can you also please update us on the team
channel?

## User Stories

Now, we have already sent you the user stories prior to today's session. It is a
long user stories documents, but it provides good indication of our vision of
the product. Therefore, please do take time to go through them and here are some
of the questions you can use to check your own progress:

1. What information is included in a jobseeker profile?
2. What is on the jobseeker homepage?
3. Whta should appear on the recruiter homepage?
4. What should appear for the applicant listing table?
5. What filters are used for sorting the applicants when the recruiter is
   viewing the application progress?
6. What filters are used for sorting potential applicants when the recruiter is
   trying to search for potential applicants?
7. What thing does the recommendation system do in the platform? (_Note that
   this is scattered between jobseeker and recruiter_)
8. When does notifications happen? (_For both jobseekers and recruiters_)

# Figma {#sec-figma}

Figma is a prototyping platforms that allow us to build frontend prototype with
a GUI similar to image editors. This is the tool that we will be using it to
communicate the UI design to the development team.

Now, can we please have you to set up an account on Figma. Please use the
education account for figma so that you get access to more functionalities on
the platform. It is important because you might not even be able to see the
project if you do not have enough access to the platform.

The link to applications for education plan for Figma can be found
[here](https://www.figma.com/education/). Please also let us know the email you
have used to register for Figma so that we can add you on the project.

# Making Your First Contirubtion {#sec-first-contrib}

Without a lie, this webpage is done by myself in a rush just probably less than
15 hours ago, so you are likely to spot problems / places for improvement on
this website. We are very open to suggestions for improvements, so if you find
anything that you would like to improve on the webpage, please open an issue.

First, can you navigate to the [about page](about.qmd) to first see how this
website is built with a tool called `quarto`.

## Contribution Guide {#sec-contrib-guide}

The overall contribution guide is very simple:

1. Open an issue for the things you are going to work on. Picking a suitable
   issue templates.
   - Note that normally we would create most of the feature requests issues for
     you. However, on occasions where you find a bug, please open an issue to
     let us know by tagging the `Admin` team.
2. Open a feature branch for your issue, preferable starting with the issue
   number (i.e. in the format of `[issue-number]-<description>`)
3. Coding, coding, coding...
4. Make an PR from your feature branch against the `main` branch
5. Request peer-review for your code.
   - Note that normally you would need Sean or Isaac to review your PR, but for
     this demo practice, you can have one of the group members to do it.
6. Merge into `main`

It is very important to keep the `main` branch always work.

## Making an Actual Contribution

Finally, one tasks for you all is to create a something similar
[Isaac's Self Introduction Page](./contents/team-member/issac-leong.qmd).

:::{.callout-important title="Contributing to the Repo" collapse="false"}

It is important that you follow the guideline in @sec-contrib-guide so that you
get used to the workflow for the future development. I understand it gives extra
burdens on you, but it is important so that everyone's work get to incorporated
into the `main` branch nicely.

:::{.callout-warning title="CI/CD" collapse="false"}

You might also notice that what you have changed is not yet visible on the
internet page. That's common because I am lazy and have not yet set up a
Continuout Deployment pipeline from GitHub. Relevant information can be found
[here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#workflow).
